      <description>I’m back from the ROpenSci Unconference in LA. A fabulous two days of R programming and, ur, playing Minecraft. As one does.
This was ROpenSci’s 4th unconference; the first I could attend. There were like 70 participants, nearly double what they had last year. The scheme is that people break up into groups and work on different projects that might be useful to the ROpenSci community. There was discussion about potential projects in advance on GitHub, and then the first morning we voted on what we were interested in doing via stickers:</description>

      <description>Next month, I’m teaching a workshop on R/qtl and R/qtl2 at the joint Complex Trait Community and Rat Genomics Community meeting (CTC-RG2017) meeting in Memphis.
I was chatting with Śaunak Sen about preparations: the main problem is installation of R/qtl2, which is split into multiple R packages, and I’ve not yet placed them on CRAN. And they’re a bit of a pain to install from GitHub (people need the proper development tools, and compilation of the C++ code is painfully slow).</description>

      <description>Matt Dowle encouraged me to follow up on my post about sqlite, feather, and fst. One thing to emphasize is that saveRDS, by default, uses compression. If you use compress=FALSE you can skip that and it goes much faster. See, for example, his post on “Fast csv writing for R”. Also see his slides from a recent presentation on parallel fread.
I’ll first generate the same data that I was using before.</description>

      <description>Back in 2014, I’d grabbed the Crayola crayon colors from Wikipedia and made them available as part of my R/broman package.
(I wrote about it on my wordpress blog, and then again and again.)
But using my package to get the crayon colors can be rather tedious.
It’s easy to view the available colors.
library(broman) plot_crayons() But grabbing a color, say “Purple Mountain’s Majesty”, requires rather verbose code.
brocolors(&amp;quot;crayons&amp;quot;)[&amp;quot;Purple Mountain&amp;#39;s Majesty&amp;quot;] ## Purple Mountain&amp;#39;s Majesty ## &amp;quot;#9d81ba&amp;quot; This morning, it was just too much for me.</description>

      <description>blogdown is cool, but it seems that it builds every .Rmd file every time you run build_site(), so if your site includes an analysis that takes a while…well, every time you build the site it’s going to take a while.
I had the mistaken impression that blogdown would look at the timestamps on the .Rmd and .html and only build the .html if the .Rmd file is newer, but that’s not true.</description>

      <description>I don’t think I’m unusual among statisticians in having avoided working directly with databases for much of my career. The data for my projects have been reasonably small. (In fact, basically all of the data for my 20 years of projects are on my laptop’s drive.) Flat files (such as CSV files) were sufficient.
But I’ve finally entered the modern era of biggish data. (Why do they call it big data?</description>
