      <description>Back in 2014, I’d grabbed the Crayola crayon colors from Wikipedia and made them available as part of my R/broman package.
(I wrote about it on my wordpress blog, and then again and again.)
But it’s rather tedious to grab the colors.
There’s a useful function for viewing the available colors.
library(broman) plot_crayons() But grabbing a color, say “Purple Mountain’s Majesty”, requires rather verbose code.
brocolors(&amp;quot;crayons&amp;quot;)[&amp;quot;Purple Mountain&amp;#39;s Majesty&amp;quot;] ## Purple Mountain&amp;#39;s Majesty ## &amp;quot;#9d81ba&amp;quot; This morning, it was just too much for me.</description>

      <description>blogdown is cool, but it seems that it builds every .Rmd file every time you run build_site(), so if your site includes an analysis that takes a while…well, every time you build the site it’s going to take a while.
I had the mistaken impression that blogdown would look at the timestamps on the .Rmd and .html and only build the .html if the .Rmd file is newer, but that’s not true.</description>

      <description>I don’t think I’m unusual among statisticians in having avoided working directly with databases for much of my career. The data for my projects have been reasonably small. (In fact, basically all of the data for my 20 years of projects are on my laptop’s drive.) Flat files (such as CSV files) were sufficient.
But I’ve finally entered the modern era of biggish data. (Why do they call it big data?</description>
