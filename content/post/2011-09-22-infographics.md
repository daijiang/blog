I saw this great infographic at [Andrew Gelman's blog](http://andrewgelman.com/2011/09/meta-infographic/).

[![MOST POPULAR INFOGRAPHICS](http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6190/6143338263_d2497c02fe.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/smoy/6143338263/)

I'm inclined to [buy an art print](http://society6.com/albyantoniazzi/MOST-POPULAR-INFOGRAPHICS-You-can-find-around-the-Web_Print?show=promoters#user_list).

Note the relationship between the central panel and the cover of the latest [Amstat News](http://magazine.amstat.org/) (always a good source for embarrassing figures):
