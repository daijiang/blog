```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```

This is the new site for my blog. Also see my
[old wordpress site](https://kbroman.wordpress.com/); I'm not going to
try to figure out how to move things over.

I'm not been writing much recently, in part because Wordpress is such
a drag to work with. The present site uses
[blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), which is a _joy_. See the
[bookdown-based documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown)
plus examples at [github.com/rbind](https://github.com/rbind).

The source for this site is at [github](https://github.com/kbroman/blog).
