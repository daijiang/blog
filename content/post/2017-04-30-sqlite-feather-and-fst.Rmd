I don't think I'm unusual among statisticians in having avoided
working directly databases for much of my career. The data for my
projects have been reasonably small. (In fact, basically all of the
data for my 20 years of projects are on my laptop's drive.) Flat files
(such as CSV files) were sufficient.

But I've finally entered the modern era of biggish data. (Why do they
call it _big_ data? That doesn't leave us much room for gradations of
size. In the 90's, statisticians talked about [_massive_
data](https://www.nap.edu/read/5505/chapter/1).) And particularly for
visualization of large-scale data, I don't want to load everything in
advance, and I want rapid access to slices of data.

So I've been playing with [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) and
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), and more recently
[feather](https://github.com/wesm/feather) and
[fst](http://www.fstpackage.org). And I thought I'd show a few
examples. I'm interested mostly in quick access, from
[R](https://www.r-project.org), to small portions of a large file.

### data, rds

Let me start by simulating some data. I'm mostly thinking about the
case of 500 100k-SNP arrays. So the data are pairs of intensity
measures for the two alleles at each of 100k SNPs in 500 samples. And
typically I want to grab the 500 pairs of intensities for a given SNP.
I'm going to just simulate IID noise, because for these illustrations
I don't really care about the contents so much as the storage size and
I/O speed.

```{r simulate_data}
n_ind <- 500
n_snps <- 1e3
ind_names <- paste0("ind", 1:n_ind)
snp_names <- paste0("snp", 1:n_snps)
sigX <- matrix(rnorm(n_ind*n_snps), nrow=n_ind)
sigY <- matrix(rnorm(n_ind*n_snps), nrow=n_ind)
dimnames(sigX) <- list(ind_names, paste0(snp_names, ".X"))
dimnames(sigY) <- list(ind_names, paste0(snp_names, ".Y"))
db <- cbind(data.frame(id=ind_names, stringsAsFactors=FALSE),
            sigX, sigY)
```

My typical approach with data like this is to save it in an RDS file and
just read the whole thing into memory if I want to work with it. But
it's rather slow to write and read such a big data set.

```{r write_rds}
rds_file <- "db.rds"
(write_rds_time <- system.time(saveRDS(db, rds_file)))
(read_rds_time <- system.time(readRDS(rds_file)))
```

So it's like `r round(write_rds_time[3])` sec to write such an RDS
file, and `r myround(read_rds_time[3], 1)` sec to read it. The file
itself is `r (rds_size <- round(file.info("db.rds")$size/10^6))` MB.

### sqlite

[Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com) is cool, and I think ultimately it
will be useful to me, but [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) has the
advantage of being a single file that you can hand to others. And
installation is easy: you just need
[`install.packages("RSQLite")`](https://cran.rstudio.com/package=RSQLite/).

SQLite won't take more than [2000
columns](https://sqlite.org/limits.html) (or maybe 32,767 if you
change a compile-time parameter), so we need to take the transpose of
our data frame.

```{r transpose_df}
t_db <- cbind(data.frame(snp=rep(snp_names, 2),
                         signal=rep(c("X", "Y"), each=n_snps),
                         stringsAsFactors=FALSE),
              rbind(t(sigX), t(sigY)))
```

Let's rearrange it so that the two rows for a given SNP are next to
each other.

```{r put_snp_rows_together}
db_rows <- as.numeric(matrix(1:nrow(t_db), byrow=TRUE, nrow=2))
t_db <- t_db[db_rows,]
```

To write to a SQLite file, we use `dbConnect` to create a database
connection, and then `dbWriteTable`. We can use `dbDisconnect` to
disconnect afterwards, if we're done.

```{r write_sqlite}
library(RSQLite)
sql_file <- "t_db.sqlite"
sqldb <- dbConnect(SQLite(), dbname=sql_file)
(write_sql_time <- system.time(dbWriteTable(sqldb, "snps", t_db,
                                            row.names=FALSE, overwrite=TRUE,
                                            append=FALSE, field.types=NULL)))
dbDisconnect(sqldb)
```

So the writing took `r round(write_sql_time[3])` sec, and the
resulting file is `r round(sql_size <- file.info(sql_file)$size/10^6)` MB.

A key advantage of SQLite is to be able to quickly access a portion of
the data, for example to grab the two rows for a particular SNP. You'd
need to know the SNP names, first, which you can do by grabbing that
column (or _field_) with `dbGetQuery`. A data frame is returned, so we
select the first column.

```{r sqlite_snp_names}
sqldb <- dbConnect(SQLite(), dbname=sql_file)
system.time(snp_names <- dbGetQuery(sqldb, 'select snp from snps')[,1])
```

We can call `dbGetQuery` again to get the two rows of data for a given SNP.

```{r query_sqlite}
random_snp <- sample(snp_names, 1)
query <- paste0('select * from snps where snp == "', random_snp, '"')
system.time(z <- dbGetQuery(sqldb, query))
```

Such queries are even faster if we first add an index on the SNP names.

```{r sqlite_index}
dbGetQuery(sqldb, "CREATE INDEX snp ON snps(snp)")
```

The file is basically the same size,
`r round(sql_size_2 <- file.info(sql_file)$size/10^6)` MB, and queries
are now all but instantaneous.

```{r query_sqlite_windex}
random_snp <- sample(snp_names, 1)
query <- paste0('select * from snps where snp == "', random_snp, '"')
system.time(z <- dbGetQuery(sqldb, query))
```

### feather

I'd understood [feather](https://github.com/wesm/feather) to be a
quick way of transferring data between python and R; [Petr
Simacek](https://simecek.github.io/) convinced me of its more-broad
uses, such as to take the place of a single-table database.

Writing a feather file is surprisingly fast, and reading it back in is
even faster.

```{r feather}
library(feather)
feather_file <- "t_db.feather"
(write_feather_time <- system.time(write_feather(t_db, feather_file)))
(read_feather_time <- system.time(t_db_clone <- read_feather(feather_file)))
```

That's about `r round(write_feather_time[3])` sec to write, and
`r myround(read_feather_time[3], 1)` sec to read, and the file is
about `r round(file.info(feather_file)$size/10^6)` MB.

But queries of particular columns or rows are fast, too. So you can
basically use feather like a database.

```{r feather_query}
db_f <- feather(feather_file)
snp_names <- unlist(db_f[,"snp"])
random_snp <- sample(snp_names, 1)
system.time(z <- db_f[snp_names==random_snp,])
```

In this particular case, it's actually a bit faster to work with
feather the other way around; that is, in the original format of 500
arrays x 100k SNPs.

```{r feather2}
feather_file_2 <- "db.feather"
(write_feather_time_2 <- system.time(write_feather(db, feather_file_2)))
(read_feather_time_2 <- system.time(db_clone <- read_feather(feather_file_2)))
```

That's about `r round(write_feather_time_2[3])` sec to write, and
`r myround(read_feather_time_2[3], 1)` sec to read, and the file is
about `r round(file.info(feather_file_2)$size/10^6)` MB.

Accessing particular rows is just as easy. First a bit of code to grab
the SNP names by grabbing the column names,
getting rid of the `".X"` or `".Y"` bits at the end, and then taking
the first half.

```{r feather_snp_names}
db_f_2 <- feather(feather_file_2)
snp_names <- sub("\\.[XY]$", "", colnames(db_f_2))
snp_names <- snp_names[1:(length(snp_names)/2)]
```

Now, we grab the data for a random SNP by pasting `".X"` and `".Y"`
back onto the SNP name.

```{r feather_query_2}
random_snp <- sample(snp_names, 1)
system.time(z <- db_f_2[,c("id", paste0(random_snp, c(".X", ".Y")))])
```

Note that you can also use [dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr)
with [feather](https://github.com/wesm/feather) as if you've got an
in-memory data frame.

### fst

After [tweeting about feather](https://twitter.com/kwbroman/status/855112575373148162),
[Dirk Eddelbuettel](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/) suggested that I
look at the [fst package](http://www.fstpackage.org/). It's not quite
as slick to take data slices, but it's potentially faster and you can write a
compressed file to save disk space.

Like SQLite, it's best not to have _too_ many columns, so we'll work
with the transposed version of the data frame, with SNPs as rows.
Writing and reading are fast.

```{r write_fst}
library(fst)
fst_file <- "db.fst"
write_fst_time <- system.time(write.fst(t_db, fst_file))
read_fst_time <- system.time(t_db_clone <- read.fst(fst_file))
```

That's `r myround(write_fst_time[3], 1)` sec to write,
`r myround(read_fst_time[3], 1)` sec to read, and the file is about
`r round(file.info(fst_file)$size/10^6)` MB.

Writing a compressed file is quite a bit slower. Here at 80%
compression.

```{r write_fstcomp}
fstcomp_file <- "db_comp.fst"
(write_fstcomp_time <- system.time(write.fst(t_db, fstcomp_file, 80)))
(read_fstcomp_time <- system.time(t_db_clone <- read.fst(fstcomp_file)))
```

That's `r myround(write_fstcomp_time[3], 1)` sec to write,
`r myround(read_fstcomp_time[3], 1)` sec to read, and the file is about
`r round(file.info(fstcomp_file)$size/10^6)` MB.

Doing queries on an [fst](http://www.fstpackage.org) file is not quite
as slick as for [feather](https://github.com/wesm/feather), but it's
fast. The `read.fst` function as a `columns` argument to grab
particular columns, and `from` and `to` arguments to grab a slice of
rows.

We'll first grab the `snp` column to get the SNP names. And let's just
work with the compressed version of the file. Since `read.fst` will
return a one-column data frame, we grab the first column to make it a
vector.

```{r fst_grab_snps}
snp_names <- read.fst(fstcomp_file, "snp")[,1]
```

Now we can choose a random SNP, find the corresponding rows, and
then use `from` and `to` to grab those two rows. You can see it's
useful to have the the pairs of rows for each SNP be contiguous.

```{r fst_grab_a_snp}
random_snp <- sample(snp_names, 1)
wh_rows <- which(random_snp == snp_names)
system.time(z <- read.fst(fstcomp_file, from=wh_rows[1], to=wh_rows[2]))
```

### timings

Let's use the [microbenchmark](https://cran.r-project.org/package=microbenchmark)
package to compare timings for grabbing a random SNP. First a bit of set-up.

```{r setup4microbenchmark}
random_snp <- sample(snp_names, 1)
library(microbenchmark)
sql_file <- "t_db.sqlite"
sqldb <- dbConnect(SQLite(), dbname=sql_file)
query <- paste0('select * from snps where snp == "', random_snp, '"')
db_f <- feather(feather_file)
db_f_2 <- feather(feather_file_2)
```

```{r time_access}
m <- microbenchmark(sqlite=dbGetQuery(sqldb, query),
                    feather=db_f[snp_names==random_snp,],
                    feather_t=db_f_2[,c("id", paste0(random_snp, c(".X",".Y")))],
                    fst={wh_rows <- which(random_snp == snp_names)
                         read.fst(fst_file, from=wh_rows[1], to=wh_rows[2])},
                    fstcomp={wh_rows <- which(random_snp == snp_names)
                             read.fst(fstcomp_file, from=wh_rows[1], to=wh_rows[2])},
                    times=100)
print(m, digits=0)
```

Here's a summary of all of the results:

```{r construct_table, echo=FALSE}
results <- data.frame(write_time= c(rds=write_rds_time[3],
                                    sqlite=write_sql_time[3],
                                    feather=write_feather_time[3],
                                    feather=write_feather_time_2[3],
                                    fst=write_fst_time[3],
                                    fst_comp=write_fstcomp_time[3]),
                      read_time=  c(rds=read_rds_time[3],
                                    sqlite=NA,
                                    feather=read_feather_time[3],
                                    feather_t=read_feather_time_2[3],
                                    fst=read_fst_time[3],
                                    fst_comp=read_fstcomp_time[3]),
                      file_MB=    c(rds=file.info(rds_file)$size,
                                    sqlite=file.info(sql_file)$size,
                                    feather=file.info(feather_file)$size,
                                    feather_t=file.info(feather_file_2)$size,
                                    fst=file.info(fst_file)$size,
                                    fst_comp=file.info(fstcomp_file)$size)/10^6,
                      access_time=c(rds=NA,tapply(m$time/1e6, m$expr, mean)))
rownames(results) <- c("rds", "sqlite", "feather", "feather (transp)", "fst", "fst (compr)")
knitr::kable(results, digits=c(1,1,0,1),
             col.names=c("write time (s)", "read time (s)",
                         "file size (MB)", "access time (ms)"))
```

I don't think we can draw general conclusions about the relative speed
and file size of the three approaches from these results. And I think
they're all really useful and interesting.

But in this particular case, the file compression didn't really help
with [fst](http://www.fstpackage.org) and slowed things down.
When accessing the data,
[feather](https://github.com/wesm/feather) was considerably faster
than [fst](http://www.fstpackage.org) when the data were organized
with the SNPs as columns, but was considerably slower when the data
were in the opposite orientation. [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)
has much faster access times, but with a larger file size that takes
longer to write.
