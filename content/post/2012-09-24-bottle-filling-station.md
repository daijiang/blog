The [Madison airport](http://www.msnairport.com) now has a bottle-filling machine, sort of like this:

[Bottle filler/drinking fountains](http://www.elkayusa.com/cps/rde/xchg/elkay/hs.xsl/elkay-com-103031.aspx) are being installed all over the [UW-Madison campus](http://www.wisc.edu), too.

I really love these things.  All airports should have them.
